Hi, I am Himansh Arora.
I am currently learning web scraping in python and app dev in Kotlin(Jetpack Compose).
I wish to join FOSS wing because I like linux.
Open Source Project Idea- I want to make a Reddit client that uses Google with flags as search engine(instead of the Native Reddit API search) as it fetches far better results.
Github Username- Humanshere
