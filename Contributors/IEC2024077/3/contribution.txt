Hello i am Tanish Mirajkar,a Electronics and communication engineering student passionate about development and network security.
I mainly use react and golang for my projects. 
I am currently learning more about golang.
Always excited to contribute to meaningful projects.


open source project idea:- I would really like to  rebuild IIIT Allahabds ERP system because the current one is useless.
I would love to keep it open source as others can also contribute something meaningful to this project making ERP highly User friendly and tailored to students needs.
