Hi, I am Krishna Kumar Sah from Madhubani.
I am currently pursuing a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering at IIIT Allahabad.
I enjoy development and coding.
I am particularly interested in web technologies and agentic AI.
There's not much else to sayâ€”I'm just someone who loves to build and learn.
