I am Sankalp Joshi and I am a Btech ECE sophomore from IIIT Allahabad. My enrollment number is IEC2024047 and my tech parent is Raghul CJ sir.
I am a web and app developer and I am also intrested in open source.

Favorite programming language: c++

Open source project idea 
I would like to work on a lost and found app and the motive behind it being open source is because developer can add and change features based on their convenience.
