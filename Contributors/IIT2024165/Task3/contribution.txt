Hello! I am Shivam Kumar,an engineering student at IIITA with a strong interest in software development.  
I enjoy solving problems,exploring new technologies,and building impactful projects.  
Currently,I am enhancing my skills in Git,open-source collaboration,and programming.  
My goal is to grow as a developer while contributing to meaningful open-source initiatives.

Open Source Project Idea :-
I would like to work on PathFinder,an open-source mobile app that lets users report road issues and uses AI to build a road quality index.  
It integrates with Google Maps APIs to suggest safer routes based on this index,while empowering communities to improve urban road management.
