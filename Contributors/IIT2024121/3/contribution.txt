Hi, My name is Omprakash Marri.
I'm learning various coding skills and how to implement them in practical use-cases.
I've been exploring WebDev decently and have some knowledge in competitive programming and DSA.
I really enjoy learning coding skills which allow me to do cool things such as using OpenGL to render shapes, which ive been recently exploring.

My favourite programming language is C++

A Proxy Manager to simplify the process of toggling proxy servers.
