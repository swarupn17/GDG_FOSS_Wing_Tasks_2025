Aspiring to leverage my firsthand experience of successfully clearing the NDA examination and SSB interview, combined with my comprehensive training at the National Defence Academy, to guide and mentor SSB aspirants in their journey to join the Indian Armed Forces. Experienced in mentoring aspiring candidates and fostering the values of the armed forces, I am ready to make a significant impact in the technology sector.
